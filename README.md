# nosql-challenge

## Overview
This repository contains my solution for the Module 12 NoSQL Challenge, where I analyzed UK food hygiene rating data from the Food Standards Agency for the magazine "Eat Safe, Love". The project involved database setup, data cleaning, and exploratory analysis using MongoDB and Python.

## Project Tasks
* Part 1: Database and Jupyter Notebook Set Up
    * Imported the establishments.json dataset into MongoDB

    * Created a database named uk_food with collection establishments

    * Verified database creation and document structure

    * Established connection using PyMongo

* Part 2: Update the Database
    * Added New Restaurant:

        * Inserted "Penang Flavours" (halal restaurant in Greenwich)

        * Updated with correct BusinessTypeID

    * Data Cleaning:

        * Removed all establishments in Dover (unwanted jurisdiction)

        * Converted data types:

            * latitude/longitude to decimal numbers

            * RatingValue to integers

* Part 3: Exploratory Analysis
    * Performed analysis to answer key questions:

        * Establishments with hygiene score = 20 (worst hygiene)

        * Highly-rated London establishments

        * Top-rated establishments near Penang Flavours

        * Local Authorities with most establishments scoring 0 hygiene

## Key Features
* MongoDB Aggregation Pipelines

* Geospatial Queries

* Data Type Conversion

* Regex Filtering

* Pandas Integration

## Technologies Used
MongoDB (noSQL Database): store and query the dataset

Python: programming language

PyMongo: database connection

Pandas: data manipulation and analysis

pprint (Pretty Print): JSON autputs for better readability

Jupyter Notebook: environment for the projects's development

## Setup Instructions
* Clone this repository: git clone https://github.com//nosql-challenge.git

* Ensure you have MongoDB installed and running

* Import the dataset: mongoimport --db uk_food --collection establishments --file Resources/establishments.json --jsonArray

## Steps to Reproduce the Project
* Run the Jupyter notebooks in order:

    * NoSQL_setup_starter.ipynb (Database Setup)

    * noSQL_analysis_starter.ipynb (Analysis)
